```{r}
library(tidyverse)
# what we want to use is the readr package -- to import data
```

## Read in some data
use path to open the data set(be specific)
there are two ways to open the files.
* absolute way(from the original folder)
* relative way(from your current working directory)
one good way of relative path is that anyone who copies this code and data and set their derectory the same way, the code still work.

Read in a litters dataset.

```{r}
litters_df = read.csv("./data/FAS_litters.csv")
litters_df = janitor::clean_names(litters_df)
```

## take a look at the data
